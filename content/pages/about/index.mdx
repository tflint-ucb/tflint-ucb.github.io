I’m Tanya Flint, a senior product innovation leader with a background in data science. I'm passionate about unraveling intricate challenges through AI-driven solutions.

My journey into computer science began in childhood with the children's book My Friend Computer, which was filled with colorful illustrations explaining algorithms and other concepts. This sparked my interest and led me from a formal business education to self-taught coding, ultimately earning a master’s degree in data science from UC Berkeley. Throughout this journey, I have built a strong foundation in creating and scaling AI-powered products and prototypes that deliver real-world value.

This site continues that journey and serves as a platform to share experiments at the intersection of AI, product development, and growth. My focus is on rapid prototyping, learning quickly, and connecting ideas to business impact.
