Hi!

I'm Tanya Flint, a data scientist turned product manager passionate about unraveling intricate challenges through data-driven solutions. Experience working on recommender algorithms, natural language models, and deploying innovative tech solutions. My journey from discovering the children's book 'My Friend Computer' in Moldova to self-teaching coding and pursuing a formal data science master's education at UC Berkeley has equipped me with a robust foundation for helping established companies navigate the complexities of digital transformation.
