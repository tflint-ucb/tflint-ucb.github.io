I’m Tanya Flint, a senior product inovation leader with a background in data science. I'm passionate about unraveling intricate challenges through AI-driven solutions.

My journey began with a childhood discovery of computer science through the book My Friend Computer. Since then, it has taken me from a formal business education to self-taught coding and, ultimately, a data science master’s degree at UC Berkeley. Along the way, I’ve built a foundation for creating and scaling AI-powered products and prototypes that deliver real-world value.

This site continues that journey and is a place to share experiments at the intersection of AI, product, and growth, with a focus on rapid prototyping, learning fast, and connecting ideas to business impact.
