>###### I managed a [classroom assignment platform](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/) where student work was published online rather than kept behind closed systems. This model motivated students to write with greater care, knowing their work could be read by a broader audience. At scale, the platform was adopted across multiple MBA classrooms, producing a steady flow of high-quality, niche content. Many of these posts ranked well on search engines, driving significant traffic and elevating us among the top university sites. In effect, classroom assignments became a competitive content engine, standing alongside formal university publications while preparing students for a professional world where thoughtful public writing is the norm.
