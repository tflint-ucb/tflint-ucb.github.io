>###### I built a fine-tuned multilabel BERT model to classify anonymous student course evaluation comments and extract actionable insights for faculty. Trained on years of hand-labeled data, the model was able to separate sentiment, categorize themes, and surface the most relevant areas for improvement. This automation dramatically reduced the time required to analyze qualitative feedback, enabling faculty to focus on implementing the changes that would have the greatest impact on teaching and learning.
